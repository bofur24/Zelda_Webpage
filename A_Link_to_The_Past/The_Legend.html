      Although The Legend of Zelda appeared first in the series of Zelda adventures, it actually takes place many years after the third game.
      In this time, Hyrule had declined, becoming a rustic land with few remaining signs of its earlier glory. The land was overrun, and Ganon
      was to blame. At the heart of the conflict lay a missing piece of the Triforce and Princess Zelda.

            Of how Ganon came by the Triforce of Power no tale is told. When she discovered that Ganon had acquired a piece of the Triforce, 
            though, Princess Zelda broke the Triforce of Wisdom into eight pieces and hid them. She knew a hero was needed to challenge Ganon, so she sent her nurse, Impa,
            to search throughout the land, even as Zelda herself was captured. <br> During her quest, Impa long evaded Ganon's reach, but in a forest glade she too fell into 
            his clutches and would have been carried off if not for the heroic actions of a passing youth named Link. Once the villains had been driven away, Impa told the young man about Zelda's secret.
            Then, unable to hold back her tears, she told him how the Princess had been taken captive.

                After countless adventures, Link gathered all eight pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom, then he scaled Death Mountain and gained entrance to Spectacle Rock.
                Ganon's great maze dwarfed any that Link had yet encountered. In a hidden chamber, he discovered a magical Silver Arrow and, taking the prize, he traced his way through
                the maze until he came face-to-face with Ganon himself. The battle between youthful hero and villainous foe raged across the chamber, but Ganon remained invisible,
                seemingly unaffected by the cuts of Link's sword. As Link began to tire, he tried a last desperate strategy, putting the Silver Arrow to the test. The bowstring sang
                and the arrow flew straight. Ganon was destroyed!

            <h3>A LEGEND IS BORN</h3>
            <p>
                In 1987, video game players were introduced to a world of magic, mystery and danger unlike any seen before-it was called
                The Legend of Zelda. Today it remains a classic. The overhead view of the world in which the central character fights his own battles makes a radical
                departure from traditional RPGs. The variety of settings, from underground dungeons to overworld deserts, and the huge cast of enemies add depth to the experience.

            <p>Most players are equally absorbed by the many puzzles within the game. You need brains as well as brawn-witness the grumbling Moblin in Level 7 who requires a snack of Bait.
                Some of the secrets go even deeper, such as the code name ZELDA which allows access to a second quest. Perhaps the biggest strength of The Legend of Zelda is that it creates an entire world in which 
                players become legends in their own times.

        The Adventure of Link takes place several years after The Legend of Zelda. An older, taller and perhaps wiser Link has seen the country prosper and villages spring up.
        But peace is a fragile commodity in Hyrule and history has a way of repeating itself. On his second adventure, Link becomes a master of magic as well as a fighter. He 
        visits many towns, fights new enemies and travels across the sea.

        Marked by the sign on his hand, Link was destined to become a hero, but in the peaceful days following his first quest, he became restless. He wandered the forests, crossed the deserts and delved into the caverns of Hyrule,
        looking for clues to explain his feeling of unease. In time he became aware of a whisper that passed between the birds, beasts, and even through the blades of grass: there was a new magic in the land, nameless and terrifying.

            Lying as still as marble, Princess Zelda slept the dreamless sleep of enchantment. When Link found her thus arrayed in the North Palace, he saw at once that she was spellbound.
            His greatest fear had come to pass. By refusing to reveal the secret power of the Triforce to a wizard, Zelda had brough on her own downfall. But all was not lost. If Link somehow unlocked
            the mystery of the Great Palace, he could save Zelda and the Triforce of Courage.

            Again Link took to the fields and forests, but these places had become wild and dangerous, inhabited by enemies of old. Link found himself relying on his wits and swordplay at every step.
            Creatures he had never before seen also waylaid him: spiders called Deelers that dropped from the trees, tall Geldarms that rose from the sands of the Tantari Desert,
            and of course the Moblins, armed with spears and hatred.

            Link's mission was to enter each of six palaces and restore a missing crystal to a statue. Together the statues created a magical lock on the Great Palace. Only by replacing the six crystals could Link open the final door. 
            In each palace, however, he had to battle a Statue Guardian of Great strength: Barba the Dragon, Ironknuckle the Knight, Carock the Wizard and others.

            As he closed the palaces, Link crossed the whole of Hyrule, from Ruto in the northwest to Death Mountain in the south, from the island Palace in the Stormy Straights to Maze Island in the far Eastern Sea. He helped villagers when he could,
            but he never lost sight of his ultimate goal. Finally after uncovering the secrets of Old Kasuto, Link pushed on to the Great Palace where he met the Thunderbird.

                    The Adventure of Link combines the overhead exploration aspect of The Legend of Zelda with the side-scrolling combat of traditional action games. Since its release in 1988, it has remained one of the most popular NES games.
                    In The Adventure of Link, people were living in towns, and these people talked to Link and asked for his help. Many of the puzzles in the game are solved through clues given by townfolk

                    With magic at his disposal and more fighting moves, Link also shows growth as a character. The game also gives the player a wider variety of activities.
