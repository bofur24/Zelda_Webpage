      Although The Legend of Zelda appeared first in the series of Zelda adventures, it actually takes place many years after the third game.
      In this time, Hyrule had declined, becoming a rustic land with few remaining signs of its earlier glory. The land was overrun, and Ganon
      was to blame. At the heart of the conflict lay a missing piece of the Triforce and Princess Zelda.

            Of how Ganon came by the Triforce of Power no tale is told. When she discovered that Ganon had acquired a piece of the Triforce, 
            though, Princess Zelda broke the Triforce of Wisdom into eight pieces and hid them. She knew a hero was needed to challenge Ganon, so she sent her nurse, Impa,
            to search throughout the land, even as Zelda herself was captured. <br> During her quest, Impa long evaded Ganon's reach, but in a forest glade she too fell into 
            his clutches and would have been carried off if not for the heroic actions of a passing youth named Link. Once the villains had been driven away, Impa told the young man about Zelda's secret.
            Then, unable to hold back her tears, she told him how the Princess had been taken captive.

            No sooner had the youth heard the tale of Zelda's sorrow than he pledged to defeat Ganon and rescue the Princess. He set off at once, knowing only that he had to collect the eight pieces of the 
            Triforce of Wisdom. At every turn in the path he met monsters and other evil soldiers of Ganon who challenged him in battle.

                Link's first task was to find the hidden dungeons where Zelda had secretly hidden the divided Triforce. Many of the entrances were disguised, and only by
                using all of his wits and the scraps of hints that he picked up along the way was he able to succeed. Inside the dungeons, he met countless enemeis, for Ganon's minions had taken hold of even the most remote chambers.

                After countless adventures, Link gathered all eight pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom, then he scaled Death Mountain and gained entrance to Spectacle Rock.
                Ganon's great maze dwarfed any that Link had yet encountered. In a hidden chamber, he discovered a magical Silver Arrow and, taking the prize, he traced his way through
                the maze until he came face-to-face with Ganon himself. The battle between youthful hero and villainous foe raged across the chamber, but Ganon remained invisible,
                seemingly unaffected by the cuts of Link's sword. As Link began to tire, he tried a last desperate strategy, putting the Silver Arrow to the test. The bowstring sang
                and the arrow flew straight. Ganon was destroyed!

                With the defeat of Ganon, Link's mind turned to the purpose that had driven him here-the rescue of Princess Zelda. One chamber remained to be ex;lored and link pushed ahead.
                Here Zelda greeted him and the pieces of the Triforces of Power and Wisdom were reunited.

            With the destruction of Ganon and the power of the Triforce restored, peace reigned once more in Hyrule. Princess Zelda now ruled the land, and the country prospered. 
            It seemed as if the shadow of Ganon had been destroyed forever. But the youthful hero of the age remained ever vigilant. Wherever Link roamed, he looked for signs of 
            Ganon's return, for he could not believe that he had truly banished evil from the land.

            <h3>A LEGEND IS BORN</h3>
            <p>
                In 1987, video game players were introduced to a world of magic, mystery and danger unlike any seen before-it was called
                The Legend of Zelda. Today it remains a classic. The overhead view of the world in which the central character fights his own battles makes a radical
                departure from traditional RPGs. The variety of settings, from underground dungeons to overworld deserts, and the huge cast of enemies add depth to the experience.
            </p>

            </div>
       </div> 
       <div class="w3-half" style="margin: 45px 0px;">
            <p>Most players are equally absorbed by the many puzzles within the game. You need brains as well as brawn-witness the grumbling Moblin in Level 7 who requires a snack of Bait.
                Some of the secrets go even deeper, such as the code name ZELDA which allows access to a second quest. Perhaps the biggest strength of The Legend of Zelda is that it creates an entire world in which 
                players become legends in their own times.
